# Multiclass Image Classification using CNN

This project demonstrates how to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into multiple categories.

## Features
- Preprocessing and augmentation of image datasets.
- Implementation of a CNN model for image classification.
- Training and evaluation with metrics visualization.
- Predicting and visualizing results on test images.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- Additional libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

## Workflow

In this project, I implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for multiclass image classification using a Jupyter notebook. Here’s a brief overview of the key components and steps involved:
- Setup and Libraries: The notebook begins by importing necessary libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, and Matplotlib. These libraries are essential for building and training the CNN model, as well as for data manipulation and visualization.
- Data Preparation:
The paths for the training and validation datasets were defined.
Image data augmentation techniques were applied to the training dataset to enhance model generalization. This included rescaling pixel values and applying transformations like zooming and shifting.
- Model Creation:
A CNN architecture was defined using Keras’ Sequential API. The model consists of multiple convolutional layers, activation functions, pooling layers, and dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
The model was compiled with an Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function.
Training the Model: The model was trained on the augmented training dataset for a specified number of epochs while monitoring validation performance. Callbacks like reducing learning rate on plateau were used to optimize training.
- Evaluation: After training, the model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and loss plotted against epochs. This helps in understanding how well the model is learning.
- Testing: Finally, predictions were made on a separate test dataset to assess the model's effectiveness in classifying unseen images.
  
This notebook serves as a comprehensive guide for anyone looking to understand or replicate the process of building a CNN for multiclass image classification tasks.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vishwastiwarig/multiclass-image-classification.git
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Add your dataset to the `data/` directory.

## Usage
1. Run the notebook or scripts to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate it:
